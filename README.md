# Folder-Scanner
Scans folders from directory chosen, then returns:
Every folder's name and size (in MBs) from root directory (no subfolders included.), listed from biggest to smallest
Every file's name and size (in bytes) that is scanned. So if a whole PC is scanned, it will show every single file.
Lists every file format (eg. txt, mp4, etc), how many times it appeared, and how much space that format takes up (in MBs), listed biggest size to smallest.
Lists GBs Scanned
